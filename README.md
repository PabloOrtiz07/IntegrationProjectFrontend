# Softtek Integration Project (Razor Pages Frontend)

This project is developed with Razor Pages, a web framework by Microsoft, and is part of the Softtek Academy .NET Project.

## Softtek Academy .NET Project

This project is an individual academic assignment for Softtek, which involves the use of Razor Pages for frontend development as part of the .NET Core 6 project.

## Description

The primary goal of this project is to create a user-friendly frontend interface using Razor Pages to interact with the RESTful API developed in the backend. This frontend will provide the user with a seamless experience for accessing and managing data from the database.

## Architecture Details

### Pages
In the Razor Pages frontend, we organize our code into pages. Each page corresponds to a specific route or endpoint in the application.

### Models
Models are used to define the structure of data objects that the frontend will use to communicate with the backend API.

### Services
Services can be used to encapsulate logic and data retrieval operations that are shared across multiple pages.

### Views
Views are the visual elements of the frontend. They define how data is presented to the user and how user interactions are handled.

## Git Statements

We will follow the same Git branching strategy as the backend. Create branches from the 'Dev' branch with the naming convention: 'feature/xxx' (where 'xxx' is the branch name).
